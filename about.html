                <p class="tablet-desktop">
                    Our organization, the Alumni Corporation, is comprised of two major strengths:
                     a Housing Corporation and an Alumni Association. These two strengths have missions that serve a singular purpose: 
                     the betterment of the undergraduate Beta Phi Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity. 
                     The Housing Corporation&apos;s mission is to plan, manage, and execute housing initiatives.  
                     The Housing corporation&apos;s mission is to engage and grow the alumni at large.
                     The Housing Corporation serves as a stable institution in the eyes of the fraternity, and its community. 
                     In support of this strength, The Alumni Corporation demands the growth and benefit of the alumni. 
                     To meet this requirement, there exists an alumni association. 
                     The alumni association is the home for alumni of The Undergraduate Chapter. 
                     The alumni association grows and fosters the alumni through outreach, activity and service. 
                     Collectively, we make up The Alumni Corporation. In turn, we support the undergraduate chapter.
                </p>
