                        The Foundation Group is cornerstone of the alumni. 
                        It serves as the group of alumni who give back in dramatic and bold ways. 
                        Said another way: This group is how we will build a house for the undergraduate. 
                        Their contributes will be the base for which the house stands on. 
                        Their legacy in Beta Phi will be inscribed in the history of the chapter.
                        This tier of alumni also receive benefits as a thank you for their continued support to the corporation.
